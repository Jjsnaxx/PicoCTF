# PicoCTF

## Overview

[PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?category=5&page=1) is a great website that I had discovered after listening to [Darknet diaries ep 43](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/43/). 
It talks about a group of uni students competing at the highest level and attainig the coveted black badge at DEFCON. They then created PicoCTF, I loved the podcast so I had a look. They do a really great job at teaching people how to compete in CTF's.

Here are just some of the practice challenges I had completed in PicoGym:

- [Obedient Cat](https://github.com/Jjsnaxx/PicoCTF/blob/main/ObedientCat)
- [Python Wrangling](
